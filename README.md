# About Our Project:

    Our Project is nothing but a bridge between Help Seeker and Help Provider. It is nothing but works to combine two needs and needies at a same place and same time. Help Seekers are none other than Job Providers. They are those who needs help of some helping hand. And Help Providers are none other that Job seekers. Both of them will find each other using our platform. Both of them will help each other and will exchange services in terms of money. Our skimpy platform will wisely accomodate their need and time for them and according to them.
          While planning for this project, only thoughts in our mind was our young and unemployed population. We thought of making that simple application which could help them earn pocket money for them selves. This pocket money will add on their confience, personality, and keep their supplies for struggle tennure on. This platform will avail them be more self dependent.
              Our Seasonal Job app is very easy to use. One can find a part-time job for himself or herself at instantaneous basis most suitable to their timing and location. These jobs are of informal types.
            Few, features we have applied and there are many more we are left with for now. Which we will add with the passing time in near future.
               Let's take a tour to our project...
